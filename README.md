## **Overview of the Image Classification Notebook**
The **"Image_Classification.ipynb"** file is a Jupyter Notebook focused on **building, training, and evaluating a CNN-based image classifier**. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a powerful class of deep learning models designed specifically for analyzing image data. This notebook likely follows a structured deep learning workflow, including **data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, evaluation, and testing**. 

This project is useful for a variety of **real-world applications**, including **object detection, medical image diagnosis, facial recognition, autonomous driving, and security surveillance**. The notebook is implemented in **Python** and leverages state-of-the-art **deep learning frameworks** like **TensorFlow (Keras API) or PyTorch**, which provide optimized tools for handling large-scale image datasets.

## **Expected Steps in the Notebook**
1. **Importing Required Libraries**  
   - Load `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`, `OpenCV`, `Matplotlib`, and other essential libraries.  

2. **Loading the Dataset**  
   - Uses `tf.keras.datasets` (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST) or loads a **custom dataset** from directories.  

3. **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
   - Convert images to grayscale or normalize pixel values (0–255 to 0–1).  
   - Resize images to a fixed dimension (e.g., 224x224 for ResNet models).  
   - Apply **data augmentation** using `ImageDataGenerator` (rotation, flipping, contrast adjustment).  

4. **Defining CNN Architecture**  
   - Build a deep learning model using **Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout layers**.  
   - Add **batch normalization and dropout** to improve generalization.  

5. **Compiling & Training the Model**  
   - Choose an **optimizer** (Adam, SGD, RMSprop).  
   - Define **loss function** (`categorical_crossentropy` for multi-class, `binary_crossentropy` for two-class classification).  
   - Train the model and monitor loss/accuracy metrics.  

6. **Evaluating Model Performance**  
   - Generate **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** using `classification_report`.  
   - Visualize **training loss and accuracy curves** using `Matplotlib`.  
   - Plot a **confusion matrix** to analyze misclassified images.  

7. **Testing on New Images**  
   - Load a random image and make **predictions using the trained model**.  
   - Visualize the classified image along with its predicted label.
